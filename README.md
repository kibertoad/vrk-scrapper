# vrk-scrapper

Scrapper for public VRK data. Exports data from https://www.vrk.lt/2020-seimo/rezultatai into CSV format.
Currently supports district-level grouping for single mandate elections.

In order to execute, run `npm run run`. This will create directory `singleMandateByDistrict` that will be gradually filled with scraping results.
